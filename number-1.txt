There are three light switches in the room where you are standing. In the adjacent
room, three incandescent light bulbs are controlled by each of these switches. You
are informed that all of the light bulbs in the other room are off, and all of the
switches are originally down and in the off position.
How can you figure out which switches match which light bulbs if you are only given
one chance to enter the room with them?

Step:
1. Turn ON the first switch.
Leave it ON for a few minutes so the connected bulb gets hot.

2. After a few minutes, turn OFF the first switch and turn ON the second switch.
Do this right before you go into the bulb room.

3. Leave the third switch OFF.

4. When you enter the bulb room:
The bulb that is ON belongs to the second switch.
The bulb that is OFF but WARM belongs to the first switch.
The bulb that is OFF and COLD belongs to the third switch.
